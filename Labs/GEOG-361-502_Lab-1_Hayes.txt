Lab 1 Report

Question 1. What is an ENVI Header File and what is its purpose?
	The header file is formatted in ASCII and contains metadata about the image (rows/columns, resolution, map projection, etc.) that allows ENVI to properly display the image.
	
Question 2. What is the required and optional information in an ENVI header file?
	There is a very large amount of possible optional fields for the header file tailored for use as needed with specific images, too much to list here, but examples are given in header . But, ENVI-format files require the following fields in the header in all cases: band name, byte order, data type, file type, header offset, interleave, lines per image per band, samples.
	
Question 3. What are the ENVI directly supported output file formats – e.g., in what data
formats can ENVI directly save data. Which of these are raster and which of these are vector?
	All output file types are exclusively raster or vector.
		Raster: BIL, BIP, BSQ, ASCII, BMP, HDF, JPEG, JPEG 2000, PICT, PNG, TIFF (GeoTIFF), TIFF world (.tfw), SRF, XWD, ArcView® raster (.bil), ER Mapper, ERDAS IMAGINE, NITF 02.00/02.10, PCI (.pix)
		Vector: shapefile, DXF, ENVI vector file (.evf)
	
Question 4. Display the Landsat ETM+ image (downtown.img) of Houston, Texas a as
False Color composite image by using the RGB color display and displaying band 4 as red,
band 3 as green and band 2 as blue. You should demonstrate your success with this by
pasting the downtown Houston portion of the image into your lab report.
	Image attached as "Q4_downtown.jpg"
	
Question 5. How many bands, rows (lines) and columns (samples) does the multi-spectral
data set “downtown.img” have? What are the pixel depth (bits or byte per pixel) and spatial
resolution (cell size)? What is the band label for each data layer?
	Bands: 3, Rows: 517, Columns: 627 
	Pixel Depth: 8-bit, Resolution: 1pix = 3m 
	Band labels: "band 2", "band 3", "band 4" 
	
Question 6. What is the datum and map projection of the panchromatic Landsat image
“houston_pan.img”? What is the geographic location of the top left corner of this image?
What is the total geographic area covered by this image in square kilometers?
	Datum: D_WGS_1984, Projection: UTM_Zone_15N (Transverse Mercator)
	Location, Top-Left: 29.81562500 N, 95.40782778 E
	Total Area (km): 2082027.402 km^2
	
	
	1253 row * 1053 col = 1388018268 pixels
	1388018268 pix * 1.5m per pix resolution = 2082027402m
	2082027402m / 1000 m/km = 2082027.402km
