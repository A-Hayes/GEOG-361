Remote Sensing

Course Description: Introduction to the principles, techniques and applications of remote sensing technology in geosciences including the analysis and interpretation of airborne and spaceborne remote sensing data for studying key earth system processes.  

Notes: Aside from direct GIS utility, topics covered in course (lighting, shadow, reflectance, angling, etc.) also be used as a diefferent perspective on visual design. Image analysis is a descriptive counterpart to prescriptive art/design, and one can look into what the image shows via visual characteristics in the same way that a picture can be built when employing those techniques and characteristics.

Run Info: No code to run; all coursework done in ENVI with data provided on geoscience lab computers/virtual machines due to ENVI licensing costs.
